/**
 * Tracks the notes held in the chord-recognition zone and reports the recognized ArrangerChord.
 *
 * Split mode (default): every held note is assumed to be a chord tone, so the held
 * pitch-class set is matched directly against interval templates (Fingered recognition).
 * Full-Keyboard mode: held notes mix chord + melody, so recognition only updates when >=3
 * notes form a known chord (trying the whole set, then the lowest 3-4), and otherwise the last
 * recognized chord is held (hysteresis) so a passing melody note never re-triggers the accomp.
 *
 * Pure: no JUCE GUI/threads. Lives on the MIDI input thread; only its ArrangerChord result crosses to
 * the engine (via a mailbox), never its internal state.
